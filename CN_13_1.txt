13. i. Packet Capture Using Wireshark

Aim:
To write a program that captures network packets using the pcap library and demonstrates basic packet sniffing similar to Wireshark.

Theory:
Packet capturing is the process of intercepting and logging traffic passing over a digital network. Libraries like libpcap provide low-level access to network packets. The program opens a network interface in promiscuous mode and captures packets. Each captured packet triggers a callback function, which can be used to analyze or store packet data. This forms the basis for tools like Wireshark.

C Program:

#include <pcap.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

void packet_handler(u_char *user, const struct pcap_pkthdr *header, const u_char *packet) {
    printf("Packet captured. Length: %d\n", header->len);
}

int main() {
    char errbuf[PCAP_ERRBUF_SIZE];
    pcap_t *handle;
    char *dev;

    dev = pcap_lookupdev(errbuf);
    if (dev == NULL) {
        fprintf(stderr, "Couldn't find device: %s\n", errbuf);
        return 1;
    }
    printf("Capturing on device: %s\n", dev);

    handle = pcap_open_live(dev, 65536, 1, 1000, errbuf);
    if (handle == NULL) {
        fprintf(stderr, "Couldn't open device: %s\n", errbuf);
        return 2;
    }

    pcap_loop(handle, 10, packet_handler, NULL);

    pcap_close(handle);
    return 0;
}

Expected Output:

Capturing on device: eth0
Packet captured. Length: 74
Packet captured. Length: 98
Packet captured. Length: 60
Packet captured. Length: 151
Packet captured. Length: 87
Packet captured. Length: 66
Packet captured. Length: 60
Packet captured. Length: 109
Packet captured. Length: 92
Packet captured. Length: 60
