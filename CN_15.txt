15. Operating System Detection using Nmap

Aim

To develop a C program that invokes Nmap with OS detection enabled and extracts the operating system information from the scan output.


---

Theory 

Operating system detection in Nmap is performed using TCP/IP stack fingerprinting, where specially crafted packets are sent to a target system and the responses are analyzed to determine OS characteristics. Since Nmap does not expose a simple C API for OS detection, programs rely on executing Nmap through command-line and parsing its output. The -O option enables OS detection and typically requires root privileges. This experiment demonstrates how to run Nmap programmatically from C and extract OS-related information.

Program

#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>

#define BUFFER_SIZE 1024

// Function to run nmap OS detection and display OS-related output
void run_nmap_os_detection(const char *target_ip) {
    char command[128];
    char buffer[BUFFER_SIZE];
    FILE *pipe;

    // Command to run Nmap OS detection
    snprintf(command, sizeof(command), "sudo nmap -O %s", target_ip);

    // Open pipe to read Nmap output
    pipe = popen(command, "r");
    if (!pipe) {
        perror("popen failed");
        return;
    }

    printf("Nmap OS Detection result for target %s:\n", target_ip);

    // Read and filter OS detection lines
    while (fgets(buffer, sizeof(buffer), pipe)) {
        if (strstr(buffer, "OS details") ||
            strstr(buffer, "OS detection performed") ||
            strstr(buffer, "Running:")) {
            printf("%s", buffer);
        }
    }

    pclose(pipe);
}

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
    if (argc != 2) {
        printf("Usage: %s <target_ip>\n", argv[0]);
        return 1;
    }

    run_nmap_os_detection(argv[1]);

    return 0;
}
