13 (B). Starting Wireshark

Aim:
To write a program that launches the Wireshark application from a C program using system commands.

Theory:
Wireshark is a GUI-based network protocol analyzer. It can be started manually or through system commands. Using the system() function in C, external applications can be executed from within a program. This allows automating the launch of Wireshark for packet capturing and analysis. The program runs Wireshark in the background and confirms whether it started successfully.

C Program:

#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main() {
    int ret = system("wireshark &"); 
    if (ret == -1) {
        perror("Failed to start Wireshark");
        return 1;
    }
    printf("Wireshark launched successfully.");
    return 0;
}

Expected Output:

Wireshark launched successfully.
